# docable

_CI for documentation_: Testing if documentation is runable.

Suppose you wanted to test the following tutorial (inspired from [benmoral](https://medium.com/@benmorel/creating-a-linux-service-with-systemd-611b5c8b91d6).)

## Example Tutorial

Let’s create a small server using PHP. I can see your eyebrows rising, but it works surprisingly well. We’ll listen to UDP port 10000, and return any message received with a ROT13 transformation:

```php
<?php
$sock = socket_create(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, SOL_UDP);
socket_bind($sock, '0.0.0.0', 10000);
for (;;) {
    socket_recvfrom($sock, $message, 1024, 0, $ip, $port);
    $reply = str_rot13($message);
    socket_sendto($sock, $reply, strlen($reply), 0, $ip, $port);
}
```

Let’s start it:

```
$ php server.php
```

And test it in another terminal:

```
client$ echo 'Hello, world!' | nc -q 1 -u 127.0.0.1 10000
Uryyb, jbeyq!
```

Cool, it works. Now we want this script to run at all times, be restarted in case of a failure (unexpected exit), and even survive server restarts. That’s where systemd comes into play.

How would we test these instructions actually work? After you updated them? On different platforms and versions of php (5 vs 7) or tools (netcat openbsd vs traditional)? After a year has passed? That's what `docable` helps do for you.

## Testing with `docable`

To test this example tutorial, we can run the following:

```bash
docable report examples/unix-service/steps.yml
```

`docable` uses a stepfile, such as the following.

```yml
setup:
 local: {}  

unix-service.md: 
  steps:
    - file: ROT13 transformation => server.php
    - serve: "start it:"
    - selectAndExpect: "another terminal:"
```

The stepfile using a "select-assert" pattern for testing documentation. That is, we first find an instruction step in the tutorial using a lightweight selector, then, we transform the step into an action we can perform within a "headless infrastructure" (such as a vm), and finally we assert it's behavior is correct.

The result looks something like this:

Turns out that our tutorial breaks if using a different version of netcat, which does not support the `-q 1` option. Oops!

After fixing the issue by changing to using "-w 1" (terminated after timeout instead of time since no STDIN input). Running `docable test`, we verify have fixed the tutorial:

## Installing docable

```
$ git clone https://github.com/docable/docable
$ cd docable/docable
$ npm install
$ npm link
```

You can switch the stepfile to use ssh provider under `setup:`.
