# Annotations

This directory contains the annotation we used for the sample of 40 tutorials in our Docable experiment. These files can be used by Docable to execute a tutorial in a given computing environment. The annotations are explained with more details in _section 2.5 (more specifically section 2.5.3)_ of the paper, and instructions for using Docable execution harness which uses these annotations can be found in [`../harness/docable`](../harness/docable).
